# d2lib
C++ Library of Discrete Distribution based Data Processing

## Data Format Specifications
 - discrete distribution over Euclidean space
 - discrete distribution with finite possible supports in Euclidean space (e.g., bag-of-word-vectors and sparsified histograms)
 - n-gram data with cross-term distance
 - dense histogram

## Basic Functionality
 - distributed/serial IO 
 - compute Wasserstein distance between a pair of D2.


## Learning
 - Nearest Neighbors (TBA)
 - D2-clustering (TBA)
